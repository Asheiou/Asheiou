### Hiya!  
  
I'm Ash (they/them)! I'm a developer, journalist, and musician from England. I manage @CubeBuilders's Minecraft server and [LIFE The Game's](https://discord.gg/QZkX3Rt/) Discord.  
I'm currently learning Java & JS, it's ... not going well ðŸ˜… - I have a lot to work on with it but I AM making progress!  
The best way to contact me is through [email](mailto:ash@asheiou.uk).  
  
That's all! <3
