### Hiya!  
  
I'm Ash (they/them)! I'm a developer, journalist, and musician from England living in Bangor, Wales. I'm the owner and lead developer at @AeoliaXYZ and I manage @CubeBuilders' MC server.  
    
I've had this account since I was in high school, so there's bound to be some absolutely awful code I haven't ever bothered to take down on here. Do not judge me by my Python!    
    
That's all I've got to say here, thank you for checking out my page.
